Use your own API key for the usage of The Movie DB API. Place a file called 'themoviedb.txt' in the
resources folder /res/raw (create if not exists). The file only has one single line, namely the API key.

##P1 - Popular Movies Stage 1

Popular Movies is an app, which enables the user to instantly look up the most popular (or top rated) movies. Starting in a grid view, the posters of the movies are shown. When the user selects a movie, a detail view shows further information, like title, year, rating, and a short description. Movie data is asynchronously fetched from [TheMovieDB.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/). The user is able to sort the movies by rating, or popularity.

##P2 - Popular Movies Stage 2

Stage 2 of Popular Movies enhances the experience of the app. The user is now able to watch trailers, read reviews, and also an offline functionality is introduced. When a movie is marked as a "favorite", the movie information gets stored in a local database, which preserves the data in a persistent manner. So the user can see movie information of favorites also when there is no internet connection. To access the favorites, another toolbar entry is added. 
Finally, the app design is optimized for tablet usage, providing a master-detail layout.
