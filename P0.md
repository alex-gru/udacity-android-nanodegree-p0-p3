***Included Udacity course: [Developing Android Apps](https://www.udacity.com/course/developing-android-apps--ud853)***


This simple container app serves as a starting point, to open the apps developed in the course projects, and was actually intended as a "warm-up" to the nanodegree course programme. The references in the app are regularily updated throughout the course, as subsequent projects are completed.
